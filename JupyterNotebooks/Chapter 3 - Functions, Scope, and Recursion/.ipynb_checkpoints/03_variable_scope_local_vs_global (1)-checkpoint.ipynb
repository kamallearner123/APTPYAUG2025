    "2. How can **shadowing** create confusion, and how do you avoid it through naming conventions?\n",
    "3. If a function **mutates** a global structure, what are the testing and concurrency implications?\n",
    "4. How do nested functions/blocks affect scope and **lifetime** of variables conceptually?\n",
    "5. If you must share data broadly, what alternatives to global variables preserve clarity (configuration objects, dependency injection)?"
