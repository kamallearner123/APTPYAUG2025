    "**Recursion** is a technique where a function solves a problem by **calling itself** on smaller subproblems until a **base case** is reached.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Core concepts**\n",
    "- **Base case**: the simplest instance with a direct answer\n",
    "- **Recursive case**: reduce the problem to smaller instances\n",
    "- **Progress toward base**: each step must get **closer** to termination\n",
    "- **Stack depth**: each call consumes space/time; beware of deep structures"

    "1. How do you choose a **base case** that is both correct and minimal?\n",
    "2. What symptoms indicate **infinite recursion**, and how would you redesign to guarantee progress?\n",
    "3. When is recursion **clearer** than iteration, and when is it **slower or riskier** due to depth?\n",
    "4. In tree traversal for AI search, how do you avoid **revisiting states** or exploding the search space (memoization, pruning, heuristics)?\n",
    "5. If a recursion processes a huge tree, how would you conceptually **limit depth** or **switch** to an iterative approach?"
