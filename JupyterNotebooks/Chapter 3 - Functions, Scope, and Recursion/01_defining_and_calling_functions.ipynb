    "## Introduction\n",
    "A **function** is a named, reusable block of logic. You define it once and **call** it many times.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Why functions?**\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: hide complex steps behind a simple name\n",
    "- **Reuse**: avoid repetition (DRY principle)\n",
    "- **Testability**: smaller units are easier to verify\n",
    "- **Collaboration**: clear boundaries between components\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Concepts**\n",
    "- **Definition**: give the function a name and describe its inputs and outputs (conceptually)\n",
    "- **Call**: invoke the function with concrete values (arguments) to get a result (return value)"

    "- A function named *greet* takes a person's name and produces a welcome message.\n",
    "- A function named *total_cost* takes unit price and quantity and gives back a bill amount.\n",
    "- A function named *normalize_text* receives a sentence and returns a cleaned version (trimmed, lowercased, etc.)."

    "## Twisted Questions\n",
    "1. If you call a function that relies on **external state**, can the result differ for the same inputs? When is that desirable vs dangerous?\n",
    "2. How does giving a function **too many responsibilities** affect readability and testing?\n",
    "3. What happens when two functions **depend on each other** in a circle? What risks arise and how can you design around it?\n",
    "4. If a function has **no explicit output**, what is its value in the system (e.g., side effects, logging, mutating state)?\n",
    "5. How do you recognize when logic belongs **inside** a function vs should remain **inline** where it is used?"
