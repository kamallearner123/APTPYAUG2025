    "A **lambda function** is a small, anonymous function written in a **single expression**. It’s useful when you need a quick operation **inline** without naming a full function.\n",
    "     \n",
    "**Why use lambdas?**\n",
    "- **Conciseness**: keep simple transformations next to where they’re used\n",
    "- **Custom behavior**: pass small functions to sorting, mapping, filtering APIs\n",
    "- **Readability**: avoid jumping elsewhere for trivial logic\n",

    "**Constraints**\n",
    "- Suited for **simple** logic\n",

    "## Twisted Questions\n",
    "1. When does a lambda improve clarity vs when should you **name** a normal function?\n",
    "2. How can a lambda that captures **outer variables** cause surprises (lifetimes, mutability, late binding)?\n",
    "3. If business logic **grows**, how do you migrate from a lambda to a properly named function without breaking callers?\n",
    "4. Are chained lambdas **elegant** or **obscure**? How would you refactor to maintain clarity?\n",
    "5. How do you document intent when lambdas are used in multiple places (comments, naming via variables, or replacing with named functions)?"
